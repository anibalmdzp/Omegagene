Celeste Developers' Guide
=========================


The developers' documentation consists of two parts:

* A developer guide that provides an overview of the celeste codebase, and
  includes more detailed resouces such as guidelines and information on tools
  used during development.
* Doxygen documentation extracted from comments in C/C++ code, documenting the
  actual C/C++ code.

The documentation does not yet cover all areas of celeste development, but more
content is being (slowly) added.
